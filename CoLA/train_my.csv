A particle is suspended in the rotor and falls into a solution when the ramp is activated. The particles coalesce around the rotor and eventually form a ring. As the ring tries to coalesce around the particle, it exerts an outward force that eventually causes the ring to separate from the main system. The paper presents a new approach for determining the effective rotor speed and size. We show that, by controlling the ramp, we can make the system evolve to a stationary solution."

Are there differences between men and women in their personal and professional lives? How do they cope with the pressures of each other? In a three-part series, Dr. Andrew Szanton (Richard Gere), a New York City psychologist, and three of his colleagues, Dr. Mary Ann O'Connell (Ann Cusak), Dr. Charles Raison (George Halpern), and Dr. James B. Donahue (Ed Harris), explore these questions and many more in a thought-provoking and engaging discussion. Part I: What is a woman's world? Dr. Andrew Szanton believes that women's worlds can be characterized by two broad categories: the private world in which they function and the public world, which they perceive. The private world is one in which they work and interact with each other, their friends and family, their colleagues, and their significant others. The public world is the world that they perceive to exist outside of their private lives."
